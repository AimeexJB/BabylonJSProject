# BabylonJSProject
The second part of my 4th year project using Babylon JS

The aim of this project is to make a 3D environment with animations and music using the javascript framework ThreeJS. The journey started off by researching the different javascript libraries out there that would best suit my ideas. As well as ThreeJS, there are other frameworks available such as BabylonJS. For this Project both of these frameworks will be compared by creating the same environment in each with the same type of interactions. ThreeJS will be used to create the main application which will then be recreated in BabylonJS, noting down the similarities and the differences as well as the difficulty in each.
